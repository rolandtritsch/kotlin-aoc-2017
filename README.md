# Porting [scala-aoc-2017](https://github.com/rolandtritsch/scala-aoc-2017) to Kotlin (to learn the language)

To make this work you need to ...

* clone the repo
* install kotlin
* install gradle
* run `gradle build`
* run `gradle test`
* run `gradle run`

If you want to develop something ...

* run `gradle test --continuous`
  * Note: If one of the tests is failing, you will see a stacktrace, but the build will still be successful.
